# project-darwin

A beginner level NEAT neuro-evolution algorithm for my Capstone project. It will be instructed to learn how to effectively play a level of a retro game through a emulation.

# NOTE:

All emulation resources will be with games I have owned a copy of, as to comply with current piracy laws surrounding game emulation. All ROM files used for game emulation are done with legitimate copies, and are not run illegaly.
